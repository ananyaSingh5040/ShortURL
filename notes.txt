Authentication :
2 Patterns - 1) Stateful : where we maintain data or state or server side 2) Stateless - no state is maintained
stateless main what we'll do is ke we'll write parking token main hi the parking lot number and would stamp it, isse no state is maintained that is 
ke you do not need to maintain a hashmap.
STATEFUL:
// Hash Map
// The diary where you make entries of the session
// Like valot parking was making a diary of entries of car numbers like that
STATELESS:
Token main hi add the entry and stamp it (JWT Token)
